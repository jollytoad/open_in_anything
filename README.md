# Open in Anything

A little Deno Deploy app to open any URL in another app or web-site.

At present it just supports opening git repos in various dev container tools,
but could potentially be used for lots of other apps.

Here's an example, to open this repo in your preferred dev container tool:

https://open-in.deno.dev/#https://github.com/jollytoad/open_in_anything

## Developing

To run in dev mode:

It's that easy.
